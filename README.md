# BesanconJupyter
Example of Besançon stellar population simulations in a Jupyter notebook, including Google Colab

Review the Besançon model website at https://model.obs-besancon.fr/.  You will need to make an account.

The sample python client by Raphael Melior uses <code>os.getlogin()</code> default username, which doesn't work on Google Colab.  The version provided here simply removes that call.

Questions and suggestions welcome.  I would appreciate acknowledgement if this notebook is helpful to you.  Thanks!
